# Vavilon Network

Vavilon Network is an innovative network where all transactions are free for users, and validators earn income from mining. This model aims to create a more accessible and environmentally friendly blockchain community.

## 2. Key Principles

- **Free Transactions**: All transactions in the Vavilon Network are free for users, making the platform more accessible and attractive to a wide audience.
- **Mining Income**: Validators earn income from mining, ensuring the stability and security of the network. This also incentivizes validators to work efficiently and maintain the network.

## 3. Key Network Metrics

- **Performance**: The network can process up to 10,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchain networks on the market.
- **Energy Efficiency**: The use of the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm allows the network to be energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
- **Security**: The network uses multiple transaction confirmations and complex cryptographic algorithms to ensure a high level of security.
- **Scalability**: The network supports scalability through the use of sharding technology, allowing many transactions to be processed in parallel.

## 4. Validators and Their Role

- **Validators**: Validators are responsible for confirming transactions and creating new blocks. They earn income from mining and are incentivized to work efficiently.
- **Incentives**: Validators receive incentives for their work, ensuring their interest in maintaining the stability and security of the network.
